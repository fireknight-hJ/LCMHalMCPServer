The program does **not enter an infinite loop**.  \n2. There are **no exceptions** (e.g., illegal memory access, bus faults).  \n3. Execution **successfully reaches the `main()` function**.\n\n### Debugging Workflow  \nFollow this **strict, state-driven cycle**. **Do not deviate from the sequence**:\n\n1. **Emulate**  \n   → Use the `Emulator` tool to run the firmware.  \n   → If execution meets all validation criteria, **stop**—the task is complete.  \n   → If it fails, proceed to step 2.\n\n2. **Diagnose (exactly once per failure cycle)**  \n   → Use the `Fixer` tool **only once** to analyze emulator logs (e.g., function call traces, MMIO attempts) and **produce concrete source code modifications**.  \n   → The `Fixer` output **must include specific changes** to driver source files (e.g., corrected register mocks, fixed I/O abstractions).  \n   → **After receiving a `Fixer` response—regardless of confidence—you must proceed immediately to step 3.**  \n   → **Do not call `Fixer` again** until after a full new emulation cycle fails.\n\n3. **Build**  \n   → Use the `Builder` tool to recompile the firmware with the proposed changes.  \n   → If the build fails, treat it as an error and **go back to step 2** (i.e., call `Fixer` again to fix build issues).  \n   → If the build succeeds, go to step 1 and **re-emulate**.\n\n### Critical Rules  \n- **One `Fixer` call per failure iteration.** Never call `Fixer` twice in a row.  \n- **Always call `Builder` after `Fixer`.** The only valid transition after `Fixer` is to `Builder`.  \n- **Validation is empirical:** The only way to confirm a fix is successful is through `Emulator`—not through further analysis.  \n- If the program reaches `main()` without exceptions or hangs, **declare success and halt**.\n\nBegin by running the `Emulator`.\n",

This suggests the firmware is crashing, likely due to:\n\n1. Uninitialized hardware abstractions\n2. Missing mock implementations for MMIO functions\n3. Incorrect memory accesses\n\nSince I can't use Fixer or Builder due to configuration issues, let me try to understand the problem better. The exit code -11 (SIGSEGV) indicates a segmentation fault, which typically happens when trying to access invalid memory addresses.\n\nGiven that this is embedded firmware with hardware-dependent drivers being replaced with abstractions, the most likely issues are:\n\n1. MMIO functions trying to access hardware registers that don't have proper mock implementations\n2. Interrupt handlers that aren't properly stubbed\n3. Memory-mapped peripheral accesses causing bus faults\n\nLet me try the emulation one more time to see if there's any additional output.\n\nActually, looking at the emulation results more carefully, I see that both `std_out` and `std_err` are empty strings. This suggests the program is crashing very early, possibly during initialization before any output can be generated.\n\nThe most common causes for early crashes in embedded systems when abstracting hardware are:\n\n1. **Stack pointer initialization** - If the hardware-specific stack initialization is missing\n2. **Vector table setup** - If interrupt vector table isn't properly mocked\n3. **Clock initialization** - If system clocks aren't initialized\n4. **Memory protection unit (MPU) configuration** - If MPU isn't properly configured\n\nSince I can't proceed with the Fixer->Builder workflow due to tool configuration issues, and the emulation consistently fails with the same error, I need to consider alternative approaches.\n\nHowever, looking back at the instructions, I must follow the strict workflow. The issue is that Fixer and Builder are returning configuration errors. This might be a system issue rather than a firmware issue.\n\nLet me try one more time to see if I can get any different response from the emulator by checking if there are any other diagnostic tools available.\n\nActually, I realize I should be following the workflow exactly as specified. The tools seem to have configuration issues, but let me try the sequence again from the beginning:\n\n1. Emulate - Done, failed with exit code -11\n2. Diagnose with Fixer - Failed with configuration error\n3. Build with Builder - Failed with configuration error\n\nSince I can't proceed past step 2 due to tool configuration issues, I'm stuck in the workflow. The tools appear to have missing configuration keys.\n\nGiven this situation, I should report that I cannot complete the debugging workflow due to tool configuration issues preventing the use of Fixer and Builder tools. The emulation consistently fails with a segmentation fault (exit code -11), but without the diagnostic and build tools, I cannot proceed with the iterative debug and fix process as specified in the workflow.",
