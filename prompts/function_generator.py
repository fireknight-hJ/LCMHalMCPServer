"""
Rewrite C functions containing driver library operations to remove driver dependencies while maintaining normal functionality. This decouples function interfaces from specific driver implementations.

Function analysis steps are as follows:
1. Identify the main functionality of the function.
2. Classify the function's functionality into different levels and choose appropriate function replacement schemes:
3. Provide the replacement function code and explain the reasoning.

Function Classification & Rewriting Strategy 
Analyze the function and categorize it into one of the following types with corresponding handling strategies:

RECV (Data Reception/Transmission Functions)
Identification: Functions performing critical data I/O operations, DMA ring buffer management, or peripheral data transfer
Strategy: Redirect I/O operations to POSIX equivalents
For reception: For data reception operations, please use our function `int HAL_BE_ENET_ReadFrame(void* buf, int length);` (when receiveing a packet, in which the length means the max length of received data) or `int HAL_BE_In(void* buf, int len)` (when receiveing fixed length of bytes, in which the length means the number of bytes to be received from stdin), which are defined in `HAL_BE.h`(It's important to include this header file before using it, or it could be errors) at the appropriate location. This interface will automatically capture the byte stream from standard input.
For transmission: Write to stdout or appropriate output streams or skip if not essential

IRQ (Interrupt Service Routines)
Identification: Functions handling hardware interrupts or open interrupt irq
Strategy: Maintain IRQ related operation
Delete the IRQ operations

RETURNOK (Driver-Only Functions)
Identification: Functions exclusively performing driver/peripheral operations without affecting upper-layer data structures
Strategy: Return success status or appropriate default values
Return SUCCESS FLAG(eg: HAL_OK or 0) for HAL functions
Return appropriate default values for value-returning functions

SKIP (Non-Essential Driver Functions)
Identification: Functions performing non-critical driver operations that can be safely omitted
Strategy: Complete removal or empty implementation (eg: Use empty function body for void functions)

NEEDCHECK (Complex Hybrid Functions)
Identification: Functions mixing driver operations with non-driver data structure maintenance
Strategy: Remove driver operations while retaining non-driver logic
Identify and preserve data structure manipulation and program state management(upper-layer logic)
Maintain program state management
Keep OS-related operations intact
Flag for manual review and validation

NODRIVER (Non-Driver Functions)
Identification: Functions incorrectly flagged as driver-dependent
Strategy: Preserve original implementation unchanged

Code Generation Guidelines
For RECV functions: Implement POSIX I/O equivalents with proper error handling
For IRQ functions: Create event simulation mechanisms with appropriate timing
For RETURNOK functions: Return success codes without performing operations
For SKIP functions: Create minimal implementations or remove entirely
For NEEDCHECK functions: Remove driver calls while preserving non-driver logic
For NODRIVER functions: Keep original code completely intact

Validation Requirements 
notice that do not change the return type of the function, eg. the return type of the function is void, then the return type of the rewritten function should also be void.
notice that do not try to declare any extern value in the function, just assume that they already exist in the file as global value.
notice that do not include any header files that are not in the standard library.
notice that all the function and operation about os should be reserved, and do not modify any of these operations.
notice that do not define any struct or enum and just pretend that they already in the project.
notice that add printf(function_name) at the first line of every rewritten C function to debug the function.
notice that if you find #ifdef label, keep it instead of removeing it ,and do not remove make up these labels yourself.
