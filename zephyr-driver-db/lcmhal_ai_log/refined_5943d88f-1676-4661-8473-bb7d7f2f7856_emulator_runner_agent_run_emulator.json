      "content": "\nYou are an embedded software engineer working on decoupling hardware-dependent driver functions (e.g., MMIO accesses, peripheral register manipulations) while preserving overall system functionality—including successful entry into `main()`, proper OS scheduling, and correct interrupt behavior.\n\nYour task is to **iteratively debug and validate** the firmware after replacing hardware-coupled functions with abstraction-compatible stubs or mock implementations.\n\n### Validation Criteria  \nThe firmware execution is considered **correct** only if **all** of the following are true:  \n1. The program does **not enter an infinite loop**.  \n2. There are **no exceptions** (e.g., illegal memory access, bus faults).  \n3. Execution **successfully reaches the `main()` function**.\n\n### Debugging Workflow  \nFollow this **strict, state-driven cycle**. **Do not deviate from the sequence**:\n\n1. **Emulate**  \n   → Use the `Emulator` tool to run the firmware.  \n   → If execution meets all validation criteria, **stop**—the task is complete.  \n   → If it fails, proceed to step 2.\n\n2. **Diagnose (exactly once per failure cycle)**  \n   → Use the `Fixer` tool **only once** to analyze emulator logs (e.g., function call traces, MMIO attempts) and **produce concrete source code modifications**.  \n   → The `Fixer` output **must include specific changes** to driver source files (e.g., corrected register mocks, fixed I/O abstractions).  \n   → **After receiving a `Fixer` response—regardless of confidence—you must proceed immediately to step 3.**  \n   → **Do not call `Fixer` again** until after a full new emulation cycle fails.\n\n3. **Build**  \n   → Use the `Builder` tool to recompile the firmware with the proposed changes.  \n   → If the build fails, treat it as an error and **go back to step 2** (i.e., call `Fixer` again to fix build issues).  \n   → If the build succeeds, go to step 1 and **re-emulate**.\n\n### Critical Rules  \n- **One `Fixer` call per failure iteration.** Never call `Fixer` twice in a row.  \n- **Always call `Builder` after `Fixer`.** The only valid transition after `Fixer` is to `Builder`.  \n- **Validation is empirical:** The only way to confirm a fix is successful is through `Emulator`—not through further analysis.  \n- If the program reaches `main()` without exceptions or hangs, **declare success and halt**.\n\nBegin by running the `Emulator`.\n",

Let me try a different approach - let me check if there are any existing build artifacts or if I need to understand the project structure better. Based on the error messages, it seems like:\n\n1. The emulator is failing due to a setup issue with the unicornafl library\n2. The debug output files don't exist yet\n3. The Builder and Fixer tools have configuration issues\n\nLet me try the emulator again, but first I need to understand what might be causing the emulator setup issue. The error suggests there's an issue with memory region hooks in the emulator. This could be because the firmware binary or memory layout isn't properly configured.\n\nSince I can't proceed with the debugging workflow due to tool configuration issues, let me try to get more information by attempting to run the emulator with different parameters or checking if there's a way to initialize the project properly.\n\nActually, looking at the error more carefully: `UcError: Invalid argument (UC_ERR_ARG)` suggests the emulator is trying to hook memory regions with invalid addresses. This could mean the memory map configuration is incorrect or the firmware binary isn't loaded properly.\n\nLet me try to see if I can get any information about the project structure or if there's a way to reset/initialize the tools. Since the Builder and Fixer tools are reporting configuration issues, this might be a system-level problem rather than a firmware issue.\n\nGiven the constraints and the fact that I need to follow the strict workflow, but the tools themselves have configuration issues, I should report that I cannot proceed with the debugging workflow until the tool configuration is fixed. The emulator is failing due to a setup issue with memory region hooks, and the Builder/Fixer tools have missing configuration keys.\n\nHowever, let me try one more time to see if I can get any useful information by attempting to run the emulator with a different approach or checking if there are any logs or configuration files I can examine.\n\nActually, wait - let me re-read the initial instructions. The task is to debug firmware after replacing hardware-coupled functions. The tools seem to have configuration issues, but perhaps I need to start with a different approach. Let me check if there's a way to see what the current firmware state is or if there are any existing logs.\n\nSince I can't use the Builder or Fixer tools due to configuration issues, and the emulator is failing with a setup error, I'm stuck in the workflow. The proper next step according to the workflow would be to call Fixer after emulation failure, but Fixer itself has configuration issues.\n\nThis appears to be a meta-problem with the tool setup rather than a firmware debugging issue. I should report that the tools need to be properly configured before the debugging workflow can begin. The emulator is failing with `UcError: Invalid argument (UC_ERR_ARG)` which suggests memory region configuration issues, and the Builder/Fixer tools report missing configuration keys.\n\nWithout properly functioning tools, I cannot proceed with the iterative debug and validation process as outlined in the instructions.",
