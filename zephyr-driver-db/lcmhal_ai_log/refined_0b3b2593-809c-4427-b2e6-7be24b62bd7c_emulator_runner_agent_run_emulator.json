The program does **not enter an infinite loop**.  \n2. There are **no exceptions** (e.g., illegal memory access, bus faults).  \n3. Execution **successfully reaches the `main()` function**.\n\n### Debugging Workflow  \nFollow this **strict, state-driven cycle**. **Do not deviate from the sequence**:\n\n1. **Emulate**  \n   → Use the `Emulator` tool to run the firmware.  \n   → If execution meets all validation criteria, **stop**—the task is complete.  \n   → If it fails, proceed to step 2.\n\n2. **Diagnose (exactly once per failure cycle)**  \n   → Use the `Fixer` tool **only once** to analyze emulator logs (e.g., function call traces, MMIO attempts) and **produce concrete source code modifications**.  \n   → The `Fixer` output **must include specific changes** to driver source files (e.g., corrected register mocks, fixed I/O abstractions).  \n   → **After receiving a `Fixer` response—regardless of confidence—you must proceed immediately to step 3.**  \n   → **Do not call `Fixer` again** until after a full new emulation cycle fails.\n\n3. **Build**  \n   → Use the `Builder` tool to recompile the firmware with the proposed changes.  \n   → If the build fails, treat it as an error and **go back to step 2** (i.e., call `Fixer` again to fix build issues).  \n   → If the build succeeds, go to step 1 and **re-emulate**.\n\n### Critical Rules  \n- **One `Fixer` call per failure iteration.** Never call `Fixer` twice in a row.  \n- **Always call `Builder` after `Fixer`.** The only valid transition after `Fixer` is to `Builder`.  \n- **Validation is empirical:** The only way to confirm a fix is successful is through `Emulator`—not through further analysis.  \n- If the program reaches `main()` without exceptions or hangs, **declare success and halt**.\n\nBegin by running the `Emulator`.\n",

This suggests that the emulator should be generating debug output, but it's failing before it can do so.\n\nGiven the constraints and the fact that the Fixer and Builder tools have configuration issues, I need to work with what's available. The segmentation fault is likely occurring because:\n\n1. **Hardware-dependent functions are not properly stubbed**: When the firmware tries to access hardware registers through MMIO, and those accesses aren't properly intercepted/mocked, it could cause a segmentation fault.\n\n2. **Missing initialization**: Some hardware initialization code might be trying to access uninitialized memory or hardware that doesn't exist in the emulated environment.\n\n3. **Stack or memory issues**: The firmware might have incorrect memory layout or stack configuration for the emulated environment.\n\nWithout being able to use the Fixer tool to analyze and fix the source code, or the Builder tool to rebuild with fixes, I'm limited in what I can do. The emulator is consistently failing with a segmentation fault, which means the firmware is not meeting any of the validation criteria (no infinite loop, no exceptions, reaching main()).\n\nSince I cannot proceed with the debugging workflow due to tool configuration issues, I would need those tools to be properly configured to continue.
