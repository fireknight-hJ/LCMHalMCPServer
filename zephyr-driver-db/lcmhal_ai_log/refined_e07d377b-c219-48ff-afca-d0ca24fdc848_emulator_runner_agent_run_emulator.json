The program does **not enter an infinite loop**.  \n2. There are **no exceptions** (e.g., illegal memory access, bus faults).  \n3. Execution **successfully reaches the `main()` function**.\n\n### Debugging Workflow  \nFollow this **strict, state-driven cycle**. **Do not deviate from the sequence**:\n\n1. **Emulate**  \n   → Use the `Emulator` tool to run the firmware.  \n   → If execution meets all validation criteria, **stop**—the task is complete.  \n   → If it fails, proceed to step 2.\n\n2. **Diagnose (exactly once per failure cycle)**  \n   → Use the `Fixer` tool **only once** to analyze emulator logs (e.g., function call traces, MMIO attempts) and **produce concrete source code modifications**.  \n   → The `Fixer` output **must include specific changes** to driver source files (e.g., corrected register mocks, fixed I/O abstractions).  \n   → **After receiving a `Fixer` response—regardless of confidence—you must proceed immediately to step 3.**  \n   → **Do not call `Fixer` again** until after a full new emulation cycle fails.\n\n3. **Build**  \n   → Use the `Builder` tool to recompile the firmware with the proposed changes.  \n   → If the build fails, treat it as an error and **go back to step 2** (i.e., call `Fixer` again to fix build issues).  \n   → If the build succeeds, go to step 1 and **re-emulate**.\n\n### Critical Rules  \n- **One `Fixer` call per failure iteration.** Never call `Fixer` twice in a row.  \n- **Always call `Builder` after `Fixer`.** The only valid transition after `Fixer` is to `Builder`.  \n- **Validation is empirical:** The only way to confirm a fix is successful is through `Emulator`—not through further analysis.  \n- If the program reaches `main()` without exceptions or hangs, **declare success and halt**.\n\nBegin by running the `Emulator`.\n",

First, let me check if there are any existing build artifacts or if I need to understand the project structure better. Since the emulator is running but crashing with exit code -11, this suggests there's a memory access violation happening during execution.\n\nGiven that I'm working on decoupling hardware-dependent driver functions, the most likely issue is that some hardware-dependent functions (MMIO accesses, peripheral register manipulations) are not properly stubbed or mocked, causing illegal memory accesses when the firmware tries to access hardware registers that don't exist in the emulated environment.\n\nLet me try to get more diagnostic information by running the emulator with different configurations or checking what functions are being called. However, since the diagnostic tools are having configuration issues, I need to work with what I have.\n\nBased on the exit code -11 (segmentation fault), I should:\n1. Check for null pointer dereferences\n2. Check for uninitialized memory accesses  \n3. Check for stack overflows\n4. Check that hardware register accesses are properly mocked\n\nSince I can't use the Fixer tool due to configuration issues, let me try to reason about the problem. The firmware is likely trying to access hardware registers through MMIO operations that haven't been properly abstracted.
