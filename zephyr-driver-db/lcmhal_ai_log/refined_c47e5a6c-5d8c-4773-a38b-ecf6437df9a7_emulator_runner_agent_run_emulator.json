The program does **not enter an infinite loop**.  \n2. There are **no exceptions** (e.g., illegal memory access, bus faults).  \n3. Execution **successfully reaches the `main()` function**.\n\n### Debugging Workflow  \nFollow this **strict, state-driven cycle**. **Do not deviate from the sequence**:\n\n1. **Emulate**  \n   → Use the `Emulator` tool to run the firmware.  \n   → If execution meets all validation criteria, **stop**—the task is complete.  \n   → If it fails, proceed to step 2.\n\n2. **Diagnose (exactly once per failure cycle)**  \n   → Use the `Fixer` tool **only once** to analyze emulator logs (e.g., function call traces, MMIO attempts) and **produce concrete source code modifications**.  \n   → The `Fixer` output **must include specific changes** to driver source files (e.g., corrected register mocks, fixed I/O abstractions).  \n   → **After receiving a `Fixer` response—regardless of confidence—you must proceed immediately to step 3.**  \n   → **Do not call `Fixer` again** until after a full new emulation cycle fails.\n\n3. **Build**  \n   → Use the `Builder` tool to recompile the firmware with the proposed changes.  \n   → If the build fails, treat it as an error and **go back to step 2** (i.e., call `Fixer` again to fix build issues).  \n   → If the build succeeds, go to step 1 and **re-emulate**.\n\n### Critical Rules  \n- **One `Fixer` call per failure iteration.** Never call `Fixer` twice in a row.  \n- **Always call `Builder` after `Fixer`.** The only valid transition after `Fixer` is to `Builder`.  \n- **Validation is empirical:** The only way to confirm a fix is successful is through `Emulator`—not through further analysis.  \n- If the program reaches `main()` without exceptions or hangs, **declare success and halt**.\n\nBegin by running the `Emulator`.\n",

The error `UC_ERR_ARG` suggests that either:\n- The memory region `[begin, end]` is invalid (end < begin)\n- The region is not properly aligned\n- The region exceeds valid memory bounds\n\nSince I cannot use the Fixer or Builder tools due to configuration issues, I need to work with what I have. The problem appears to be in the emulator setup itself, not in the firmware code. This could be because:\n\n1. The memory regions defined for MMIO access are incorrect\n2. The firmware binary is not being loaded at the correct address\n3. There's an issue with how hardware abstraction stubs are being set up\n\nGiven that I'm unable to proceed with the normal debugging workflow due to tool configuration issues, I should report this limitation. However, based on the error, I can suggest that the issue likely lies in the emulator configuration file where memory regions are defined for MMIO access. The regions might have invalid start/end addresses or might be overlapping incorrectly.\n\nThe typical fix would be to:\n1. Check the emulator configuration file for memory region definitions\n2. Ensure all MMIO regions have valid start and end addresses (end > start)\n3. Verify that regions don't overlap in problematic ways\n4. Check that the firmware loading address is within valid memory ranges\n\nWithout access to the Fixer and Builder tools, I cannot implement these fixes.
