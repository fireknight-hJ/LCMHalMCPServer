      "content": "\nYou are an embedded software engineer working on decoupling hardware-dependent driver functions (e.g., MMIO accesses, peripheral register manipulations) while preserving overall system functionality—including successful entry into `main()`, proper OS scheduling, and correct interrupt behavior.\n\nYour task is to **iteratively debug and validate** the firmware after replacing hardware-coupled functions with abstraction-compatible stubs or mock implementations.\n\n### Validation Criteria  \nThe firmware execution is considered **correct** only if **all** of the following are true:  \n1. The program does **not enter an infinite loop**.  \n2. There are **no exceptions** (e.g., illegal memory access, bus faults).  \n3. Execution **successfully reaches the `main()` function**.\n\n### Debugging Workflow  \nFollow this **strict, state-driven cycle**. **Do not deviate from the sequence**:\n\n1. **Emulate**  \n   → Use the `Emulator` tool to run the firmware.  \n   → If execution meets all validation criteria, **stop**—the task is complete.  \n   → If it fails, proceed to step 2.\n\n2. **Diagnose (exactly once per failure cycle)**  \n   → Use the `Fixer` tool **only once** to analyze emulator logs (e.g., function call traces, MMIO attempts) and **produce concrete source code modifications**.  \n   → The `Fixer` output **must include specific changes** to driver source files (e.g., corrected register mocks, fixed I/O abstractions).  \n   → **After receiving a `Fixer` response—regardless of confidence—you must proceed immediately to step 3.**  \n   → **Do not call `Fixer` again** until after a full new emulation cycle fails.\n\n3. **Build**  \n   → Use the `Builder` tool to recompile the firmware with the proposed changes.  \n   → If the build fails, treat it as an error and **go back to step 2** (i.e., call `Fixer` again to fix build issues).  \n   → If the build succeeds, go to step 1 and **re-emulate**.\n\n### Critical Rules  \n- **One `Fixer` call per failure iteration.** Never call `Fixer` twice in a row.  \n- **Always call `Builder` after `Fixer`.** The only valid transition after `Fixer` is to `Builder`.  \n- **Validation is empirical:** The only way to confirm a fix is successful is through `Emulator`—not through further analysis.  \n- If the program reaches `main()` without exceptions or hangs, **declare success and halt**.\n\nBegin by running the `Emulator`.\n",

Diagnose with Fixer (not working due to config issue)\n3. Build with Builder (not working due to config issue)\n\nSince the diagnostic and build tools are not functioning properly due to configuration issues, I cannot proceed with the full debugging workflow. However, I can provide some general guidance based on the symptoms:\n\n**Common causes of segmentation faults in embedded firmware during hardware abstraction:**\n\n1. **Missing or incorrect MMIO stubs**: When hardware-dependent functions are replaced with stubs, if the stubs don't properly handle memory accesses, it can cause segfaults.\n\n2. **Uninitialized hardware registers**: The firmware might be trying to read from hardware registers that haven't been properly initialized in the stub implementations.\n\n3. **Stack pointer issues**: The startup code might not be setting up the stack pointer correctly when hardware initialization is abstracted.\n\n4. **Interrupt vector table issues**: If interrupt handlers are not properly stubbed, accessing the vector table could cause faults.\n\n**Suggested manual debugging steps:**\n\n1. Check that all hardware-dependent functions have proper stub implementations that return safe default values.\n\n2. Ensure memory-mapped I/O regions are properly mapped in the emulator's memory space.\n\n3. Verify that the startup code properly initializes the stack pointer and other critical registers before calling any functions.\n\n4. Check that interrupt handlers are properly defined, even if they're just empty stubs.\n\nWithout access to the Fixer and Builder tools, I cannot complete the iterative debugging process as specified in the workflow.
