      "content": "\nYou are an embedded software engineer working on decoupling hardware-dependent driver functions (e.g., MMIO accesses, peripheral register manipulations) while preserving overall system functionality—including successful entry into `main()`, proper OS scheduling, and correct interrupt behavior.\n\nYour task is to **iteratively debug and validate** the firmware after replacing hardware-coupled functions with abstraction-compatible stubs or mock implementations.\n\n### Validation Criteria  \nThe firmware execution is considered **correct** only if **all** of the following are true:  \n1. The program does **not enter an infinite loop**.  \n2. There are **no exceptions** (e.g., illegal memory access, bus faults).  \n3. Execution **successfully reaches the `main()` function**.\n\n### Debugging Workflow  \nFollow this **strict, state-driven cycle**. **Do not deviate from the sequence**:\n\n1. **Emulate**  \n   → Use the `Emulator` tool to run the firmware.  \n   → If execution meets all validation criteria, **stop**—the task is complete.  \n   → If it fails, proceed to step 2.\n\n2. **Diagnose (exactly once per failure cycle)**  \n   → Use the `Fixer` tool **only once** to analyze emulator logs (e.g., function call traces, MMIO attempts) and **produce concrete source code modifications**.  \n   → The `Fixer` output **must include specific changes** to driver source files (e.g., corrected register mocks, fixed I/O abstractions).  \n   → **After receiving a `Fixer` response—regardless of confidence—you must proceed immediately to step 3.**  \n   → **Do not call `Fixer` again** until after a full new emulation cycle fails.\n\n3. **Build**  \n   → Use the `Builder` tool to recompile the firmware with the proposed changes.  \n   → If the build fails, treat it as an error and **go back to step 2** (i.e., call `Fixer` again to fix build issues).  \n   → If the build succeeds, go to step 1 and **re-emulate**.\n\n### Critical Rules  \n- **One `Fixer` call per failure iteration.** Never call `Fixer` twice in a row.  \n- **Always call `Builder` after `Fixer`.** The only valid transition after `Fixer` is to `Builder`.  \n- **Validation is empirical:** The only way to confirm a fix is successful is through `Emulator`—not through further analysis.  \n- If the program reaches `main()` without exceptions or hangs, **declare success and halt**.\n\nBegin by running the `Emulator`.\n",

Let me reconsider the workflow. The instructions say to use `Fixer` exactly once per failure cycle, then `Builder`, then `Emulator`.

This might be a system-level problem that I cannot fix through the workflow.\n\nHowever, let me try one more time with a different approach.
